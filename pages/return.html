      <h3>Custom Portrait Returns</h3>
      <p>Due to the customized nature of the products we produce at Crown and Paw, we cannot offer returns. Your artwork is designed with care and is entirely personal to you and your pet.
      </p>
      <p>If you are unhappy with your final product then please get in touch with us. Customer satisfaction is one of our passions and we always endeavour to make sure you're happy with the final masterpiece.
      </p>
      <p>If you received the wrong product, and incorrect size or print, or your product was damaged in transit, we will of course replace it without question. Please let us know within 48 hours of receiving your order in this case.
      </p>
      <p>We offer unlimited edits to the photo and costume you originally ordered. Unlimited revisions refer to small changes that can be done to the artwork. If you require a substantial change (e.g. new photo or costume/product change) then you have an option to either change the photo OR change the costume only once for an order. If you wish to use a third photo for your pet's artwork, OR would want to change the costume for the third time, our customer support team can send you an invoice of $10 that will cover the creation of the new artwork.
      </p>
      <p>If you have placed an order recently and have changed your mind, you can cancel your order within 24 hours. If 24 hours have passed, the cancellation will be granted at our discretion. The reason for this is that our artists often begin work as soon as you have placed your order. If your artwork has already been created and you request to cancel, we will charge a $10 fee to cover some of the artwork costs for your order.

      </p>
      <p>Please be aware that when we create your artwork, we use the photo you uploaded with your order. If you do not follow our Photo Guide, we cannot offer any solution. It's your responsibility to submit a high quality photo that adheres to our submission guidelines. Low quality photos will result in low quality artwork. We do allow for notes to be added to orders in case you have anything to let us know about. However, we can't guarantee that special requests will be adhered to - for example we cannot edit a photo to close or open a mouth, add a smile etc. We can however, remove red eye, edit eye color and other requests.

      </p>
      <p>Please note that all examples on site were made from high quality, high resolution photos. Blurry, low quality photos will not allow our design team to produce the high quality finish you see on site.
